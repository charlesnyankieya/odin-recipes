    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p>A Reuben sandwich is one of my family's fix-it-quick favorites.
         They are really delicious and easy to make.
         I like to serve them with big bowls of steaming vegetable soup and dill pickles on the side.

                <li>Meat: This super meaty sandwich has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
<li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>

<li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
<li>Spices and seasonings: This sandwich recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
<li>sandwich noodles: Use store-bought or homemade sandwich noodles.</li>
<li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this sandwich extra decadent.</li>
<li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the sandwich when you cut into it</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Steps</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Cook the noodles.</li>

                <li>Let the sandwich rest before serving.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><b> How long to cook</b></p>
            <p>The assembled sandwich should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. 
                Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. 
                Also, it's important to let the sandwich rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.</p>
